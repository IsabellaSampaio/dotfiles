# Main configs 

This is a repository for the main configs that I use for programming and productivity. Here it will be possible to find my configs for vim, zsh, and other tools that I've been using 

### Vim config
* To set your configs on .vimrc file, you can simply copy the settings from vimconfigs.txt to your .vimrc file by entering on the command line:
  ```bash
  ~ cp vimconfigs.txt .vimrc  
  ```
* And then on your vim environment run the command below to make sure that the new configs are all set:
  ```bash
  :source .vimrc
  ```
